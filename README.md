#  modularity clustering algorithm
Implemented clustered algorithm to examination of clustering algorithms to reduce dependency for CS 401 project

Algorithms in this project:

    FirstOwnAlgorithm: It is our algorithm that we basically aim for. Algorithm use include dependencies.
                       Equivalent to O (n ^ 2).
                       Pros: It is easy to apply.
                       Cons: It does not give accurate values. The reason is that when we do not use any method or variable of a class, if we include that class, it will depend                                on that class. However, it actually does not have any feature that depends on that class.
